# ðŸ§¹ ChatGPT Chat Deletion Features â€“ Product Owner Simulation

This project simulates the design of new features aimed at improving the user experience when managing chat history on ChatGPT.  
The goal is to showcase the role of a **Product Owner** in identifying needs, defining functionalities, and building a product roadmap â€” **without writing code**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Enable users to:
- Delete all chats from a selected month
- Manually select specific chats for deletion
- Use a clear and intuitive interface with a contextual "trash" icon

## ðŸ’¼ Role in the Project

**Product Owner** â€“ I identified a real user pain point, wrote user stories, created a roadmap, and led the feature definition process.  
This project serves as a practical example for my professional portfolio.
