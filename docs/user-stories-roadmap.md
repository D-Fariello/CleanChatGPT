# 🧾 User Stories & Roadmap – ChatGPT Chat Deletion Features

## 📋 User Stories (Agile format)

### US1 – Monthly deletion
**As** a ChatGPT user  
**I want** to delete all chats from a specific month  
**So that** I can quickly free up space and keep my chat history organized.

### US2 – Manual chat selection
**As** a user  
**I want** to manually select which chats to delete  
**So that** I can keep only the important conversations.

---

### US3 – Contextual trash icon
**As** a user  
**I want** to see a “trash” icon that appears based on my selection  
**So that** I clearly understand what I’m about to delete.
